# System Design (Java Perspective)

This repository contains my personal notes, examples, and learning material on system design, focused from a **Java backend developer's** point of view. I'm using this space to understand how distributed systems are built and how core components work together in real-world architectures.

## 📚 Why This Repo?

As a Java developer, I want to:
- Deepen my understanding of backend architecture
- Explore how scalable systems are designed
- Connect system design concepts with real Java-based implementation ideas

## 🧠 Topics I'm Exploring

- Key system design fundamentals  
- Architecture styles: Monolith vs Microservices  
- Java-centric backend patterns  
- Common system components: Load Balancer, Cache, Queue, DB, etc.  
- Design trade-offs (e.g., CAP Theorem, latency vs throughput)  
- Real-world system breakdowns: Instagram, YouTube, etc.

## ☕ Java Focus

Where applicable, I connect concepts to:
- Java frameworks (Spring Boot, etc.)
- REST APIs & Microservices
- Tools like Kafka, Redis, MySQL, MongoDB
- Threading, performance tuning, and JVM-level concerns

## 📝 Notes

- This repo is **only for personal learning and experimentation**
- Notes are evolving as I continue exploring
- Not intended as a tutorial or formal guide
